# Request for grade

## Overview

Since the goal of this project is to prove to me that you can do everything learned this term I want a written statement denoting your proof—and a grade you think you deserve.

The written explanation should be a list of things we learned this term that you applied to your website. **Most importantly how and why your website proves you can do the things we learned this term.** Explain to me **why** you deserve the grade you chose for yourself.

- Give yourself a grade for the project: F, C, B, A, A+<br>
- Write an explanation as to why the website shows you’ve learned and can apply everything from the term.
- Be honest with yourself and with me (I’ll notice if you’re not)

**I will read your explanation while looking over your websites. If your feedback is honest and just, you will receive the mark you chose.**
