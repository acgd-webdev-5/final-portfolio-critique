# Final portfolio critique

## Overview

Select 3 of your peers and get them to [critique your pattern library ➔](/courses/shared/peer-evaluation/)

Also consider performing [usability tests ➔](topics/usability-testing-checklist/)

**Try to get feedback on improving your portfolio website—to make it the most amazing-est!**

*Record the feedback as Issues in GitHub attached to your `portfolio` repo so they can be tracked & followed up on.*

This is part of the “Hand-in” component of the final portfolio website itself.
